The goal of this project is to create a program that prompts the user to input two coordinate points.
These coordinate points will then be used to calculate the linear equation of the line in between those two points,
the slope and y-intercept of that mentioned line, and the distance between the two points.

LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
    - private double x1 - Represents the x value of the first coordinate
    - private double y1 - Represents the y value of the first coordinate
    - private double x2 - Represents the x value of the second coordinate
    - private double y2 - Represents the y value of the second coordinate.
Constructor
    public LinearEquation(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        - Constructs an object and declares its private variables to their respective parameters.
Methods
    public double Slope(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        - Returns the quotient of the difference between y2 and y1 and the difference between x2 and x1, rounded
        to the nearest hundredth.
    public double YIntercept(double slope, double y, double x)
        - Returns the difference between y and the product of slope and x.
    public String SlopeInterceptForm(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double b)
        - Returns a String comprised of "y = " + the difference between y2 and y1 + "/" + the difference
        between x2 and x1 + "x + " + b".
    public double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        - Returns the square root of the sum of (x2 - x1) multiplied by itself, and (y2 - y1) multiplied by itself.
    public String toString()
        - Returns all the information of the object, including the coordinates of the two points, the slope, the
        y-intercept of the two points the equation of the line in between the two points in slope-intercept form,
        and the distance between the two points
