LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
    - private double x1 - Represents the x value of the first coordinate
    - private double y1 - Represents the y value of the first coordinate
    - private double x2 - Represents the x value of the second coordinate
    - private double y2 - Represents the y value of the second coordinate
    - private double slope - Represents the slope of the line between the two coordinates
    - private double yIntercept - Represents the y-intercept of the line between the two coordinates
    - private double distance - Represents the distance between the two coordinates.
Constructor
    public LinearEquation(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        - Constructs an object and declares its private variables as follows:
            - x1 as x1
            - y1 as y1
            - x2 as x2
Methods
    public double Slope()
        - Returns the quotient of the difference between y2 and y1 and the difference between x2 and x1, rounded
        to the nearest hundredth.
    public double YIntercept()
        - Returns the difference between y and the product of the return value of the Slope() method
         and x.
    public String SlopeInterceptForm()
        - Returns a String comprised of "y = " + the difference between y2 and y1 + "/" + the difference
        between x2 and x1 + "x + " + the return value of the YIntercept() method".
    public double distance()
        - Returns the square root of the sum of (x2 - x1) multiplied by itself,
        and (y2 - y1) multiplied by itself.
    public String toString()
        - Returns all the information of the object, including the coordinates of the two points,
        the slope, the y-intercept of the two points the equation of the line in between the two
        points in slope-intercept form, and the distance between the two points.
EquationRunner
    Import the Scanner class for user input.
    Step 1: Ask the user to type the first coordinate point, and store the response to a String
    variable coordOne.
    Step 2: Ask the user to type the second coordinate point, and store the response to a String
    variable coordTwo.
    Step 3: Create an instance of the LinearEquation class called LinearEquation
     with the arguments as follows:
        - x1 as the x value of coordOne (parsed out of the String literal)
        - y1 as the y value of coordOne (parsed out of the String literal)
        - x2 as the x value of coordTwo (parsed out of the String literal)
        - y2 as the y value of coordTwo (parsed out of the String literal)
    Step 4: Print out the LinearEquation instance.
    Step 5: Set a double variable Slope to the result of calling the Slope method in the
    LinearEquation instance, then ask the user to type another x value.
    Step 6:
