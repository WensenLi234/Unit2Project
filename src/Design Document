LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
    - private double x1 - Represents the x value of the first coordinate
    - private double y1 - Represents the y value of the first coordinate
    - private double x2 - Represents the x value of the second coordinate
    - private double y2 - Represents the y value of the second coordinate
    - private double slope - Represents the slope of the line between the two coordinates
    - private double yIntercept - Represents the y-intercept of the line between the two coordinates
    - private double distance - Represents the distance between the two coordinates.
Constructor
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
        - If x2 is not equal to x1, this will construct
         an object and declares its private variables as follows:
            - x1 as x1
            - y1 as y1
            - x2 as x2
            - y2 as y2
            - slope as the return value of calling slope()
            - yIntercept as the return value of calling yIntercept()
            - distance as the return value of calling distance()
Methods
    public double round(double nearest, double value)
        - Returns the quotient of the value multiplied by nearest as an int and nearest.
    public double slope()
        - Returns the quotient of the difference between y2 and y1 and
         difference between x2 and x1, rounded using the round() method.
    public double yIntercept()
        - Returns the difference between y1 and slope multiplied by x1.
    public String SlopeInterceptForm()
        - Returns a String comprised of "y = " + the difference between y2 and y1 + "/" + the difference
        between x2 and x1 + "x + " + the return value of the YIntercept() method".
    public double distance()
        - Returns the square root of the sum of (x2 - x1) multiplied by itself,
        and (y2 - y1) multiplied by itself, rounded using the round() method.
    public double findY(double x)
        - Returns the product of the argument of x and the instance's slope literal.
    public String toString()
        - Returns a String that contains one line for each variable the instance has, followed by
        ": " and the literal of the respective variable.

EquationRunner
    Import the Scanner class for user input.
    Import the NumberFormat class for conversion from String to number.
    Step 1: Ask the user to type the first coordinate point, and remove all spaces from the response and
    store it to a String variable coordOne.
    Step 2: Ask the user to type the second coordinate point, and remove all spaces from the response and
    store it to a String variable coordTwo.
    Step 3: Create an instance of the LinearEquation class called LinearEquation
     with the arguments as follows:
        - x1 as the x value of coordOne (parsed out of the String literal converted to a number using Int.parseInt)
        - y1 as the y value of coordOne (parsed out of the String literal converted to a number using Int.parseInt)
        - x2 as the x value of coordTwo (parsed out of the String literal converted to a number using Int.parseInt)
        - y2 as the y value of coordTwo (parsed out of the String literal converted to a number using Int.parseInt)
    Step 4: Print out the LinearEquation instance.
    Step 5: Ask the user for an x-value, and store the response to a double variable coordThreeX.
    Step 6: Print out the return of calling the LinearEquation instance's findY() method,
     rounded using the LinearEquation class's round() method.
